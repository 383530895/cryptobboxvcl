CryptoBlackbox License Agreement version 6.2

CryptoBlackbox is a commercial product available for use in third-party software according to the terms of the License Agreement that is stated below.

As the license agreement is written in legal language which is sometimes hard to understand, here's a brief explanation of its terms in plain text.

    The rights are given by the License Agreement free of charge. You do not need to pay a fee use The Software, to which this license applies.
    According to this license you have the right to use CryptoBlackbox without paying any fees in your end-user applications. Only the applications that are not distributed in complete source code are allowed to use CryptoBlackbox. The goal of this statement is to prevent distribution of SecureBlackbox source code. If the application uses CryptoBlackbox and is distributed in source code, the users must download CryptoBlackbox separately.
    You have the right to distribute CryptoBlackbox in compiled form (or in a form of ActiveX object, DLL library, .NET Assembly etc. which were received from EldoS) with your end-user applications or web services. Distribution of CryptoBlackbox source code is strictly prohibited.
    If you are a developer of an ActiveX object, shared object, dynamic-link library, Java bean, Delphi component or other similar library that is developed for use by third-parties external to your company, please note that use and distribution of CryptoBlackbox in Middleware is not covered by this license. If you want to use CryptoBlackbox in your Middleware (as named before), please read about re-use in development solutions.
    CryptoBlackbox authors are not responsible for any damage caused by use or impossibility to use CryptoBlackbox in your applications. However we engage ourselves to fix the reported bugs if possible.
